The 2025 Design Show celebrates the work of graduating students from the MA in Digital Design & Fabrication and the BFA Graphic Design programs in the Department of Design at SUNY New Paltz.

## BFA Graphic Design Senior Thesis Project

The BFA Graphic Design Thesis is a year-long, focused exploration of a topic of their choice. In two semesters, students investigate a subject, develop a proposal, engage in design research methods, and create final design outcomes through iterative processes. Students gain experience in visual problem-solving and critical thinking while connecting their design skills to audiences and professional design practices.

## MS Digital Design & Fabrication Senior Thesis Project

The Digital Design & Fabrication (DDF) degree prepares students to utilize modern digital fabrication methods in the design and fabrication process. Through an approach that blurs traditional boundaries between art, engineering, design, fabrication, and science, MA students' final work demonstrates a range of advanced manufacturing and fabrication techniques.
