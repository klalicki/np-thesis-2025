bio: |
  Daniella Rivera, a graduating senior from Long Island, NY, loves bold visuals, playful branding, and designing with emotion in mind. Her thesis project, Resonance, dives into how music connects us through feeling and interaction. When she’s not designing, she’s probably gaming, vibing to Ricky Montgomery, or enjoying the rain with a new playlist on repeat.

_Resonance_ is an interactive card game that explores the deep and often surprising connections between music and emotion. Rooted in personal experience and collective memory, the game invites players to respond to situational prompts using emotion cards that reflect how specific songs make them feel. With a minimal yet expressive design language—color-coded shapes symbolizing different emotions—Resonance encourages empathy, reflection, and conversation.  

The game’s mechanics reward emotional alignment, making each round a window into how individuals interpret and connect through a sonic experience. Inspired by music therapy, group dynamics, and the psychology of music, this project blends graphic design, game design, and emotional research into a playful yet thoughtful experience. Resonance invites players to listen, feel, and discover what resonates.
