Dungeons & Dragons has several bulky handbooks that are very daunting to new players and difficult to digest for those with reading difficulties. “TLDR: D&D,” or the formal title of _Too Long Didn’t Read: Dungeons & Dragons_, is meant to lower the barriers for those who struggle reading such information dense handbooks. “TLDR: D&D” is not meant to be a complete replacement for the information in the handbooks, leaving out more advanced functions. It simply explains enough for someone to play their first game of Dungeons & Dragons.
