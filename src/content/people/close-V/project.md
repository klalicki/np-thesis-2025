The idea behind A Place for US came from my own experience living as a teenager in Syracuse, NY. Back at home my friends and I were night owls and we would often hang out late at night, but it never felt like we were wanted anywhere past 10PM. Too young to enjoy nightlife, but also too old to keep playing on the playground at the park-- there never felt like there was a place that was meant for young people.
 
I find that having or finding a place to hang out is still a problem even into my college years, so I started asking other people:If you could design a 24-hour community space any way you wanted to, what would it look like? What would you want out of it? I have been collecting drawings of these imaginative spaces that have come from my peers, friends, and total strangers. The goal of my project is to publicly display these imagined theoretical spaces, and to start a conversation around community spaces as a whole.
