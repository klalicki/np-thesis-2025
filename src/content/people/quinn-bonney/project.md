My thesis explores doodling as both a form of personal expression and an intentional communication tool. Beginning with collaborative sessions where participants express themselves freely on shared parchment—highlighting individual styles without the pressure of a final product—the project examined how doodling creates space for authentic self-expression. It then evolved to demonstrate how these same informal visual techniques can be used to break down complex topics and communicate ideas effectively. Through participatory experiences and a series of newsletters on Substack, my project positions doodling as a legitimate design practice with distinct advantages over more formal visual communication methods.
