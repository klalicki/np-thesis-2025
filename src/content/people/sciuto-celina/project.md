What do you do with your clothes that aren’t perfect anymore? Do you immediately throw them away and buy a new piece, or do you try to fix what’s broken? Mending one’s clothing used to be essential, not a choice. Before the introduction of fast fashion in the late 20th century, it was very common for people to make repairs to their clothing for various types of wear and tear. Nowadays, most people throw away their imperfect clothing; this, paired with overconsumption is creating an excess of textile waste that is harmful to the environment.

The aim of this project is to empower young adults to extend the life of their beloved clothes through visible mending and repair. _Mend What Matters_ is an instructional guidebook for sewing/mending beginners, showcasing the most essential methods and techniques to get the job done. Through collage, illustrations, and found objects the book provides resources and tutorials for visible mending.
