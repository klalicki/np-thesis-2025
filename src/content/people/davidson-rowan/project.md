Have you ever been in a hallway so monotonous that it made you quicken your pace, or a room so empty that it made you turn tail? My project is all about these liminal spaces. Described as the uncanny valley of architecture, these spaces are often places of transition or pause that have been stripped of their purpose. As I visited these spaces, I found that despite their outward appearance, these places were teeming with stories and memories. On my website, you can explore my own personal photos of these spaces and read my anecdotes about each. _Lost & Found_ is a love letter to the websites of the early 2000s, and evokes the aesthetics that were used during that time. Bright colors, funky fonts, playful gifs, _Lost & Found_ has it all. I hope you enjoy exploring my memories, and I hope you find what you're looking for.
