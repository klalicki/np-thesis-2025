Throughout the Women's Suffrage Movement in the United States, the use of posters was an important part of its success with the ability to spread messages to a wider audience. In this project, I hope to show the evolution of Women’s Suffrage posters and the fight for the right to vote, including background information of key events. Beginning at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1884 to 1920 when the 19th amendment was passed, the project includes an interactive website timeline of the Women's Suffrage posters and shows the progress and history of the movement. With everything going on in the country, it is hard to keep fighting but together we can have an impact and we can do great things if we all vote for what we believe is right.
