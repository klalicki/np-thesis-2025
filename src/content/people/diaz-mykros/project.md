_The Back of Your Notebook_ is a thesis that aims to help artists who struggle with using their sketchbooks as the outlet of creativity and ideas that it's meant to be. When you hesitate to put pen to paper because of all these thoughts and worries about each line going wrong, it's a sign to go back to the basics: drawing for the sake of drawing. 
_“The Back of Your Notebook”_ references your middle school days of turning your notebook to the last page to doodle silly things. I aim to remind artists that you don’t have to make a masterpiece every time you draw. We seem to forget sometimes that your sketchbook isn’t meant to be your portfolio. It’s a playground where you can experiment and play with ideas however you want.
