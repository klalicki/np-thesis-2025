_Graphic Content_ is a book focused graphic designers' small but mighty role in film and TV production. Referred to as one of the “invisible” roles in Hollywood, their work is created with the intention of blending into the background—meant to be seen but not noticed. The project celebrates the intersection between cinema and design, recognizing the work of designers who often get overlooked. 

This book explores the creative process of a graphic prop designer and highlights artists who contribute to some of your favorite media. Whether it’s a fake newspaper, a vintage storefront sign, or a believable brand logo, these little details quietly support the story being told. Although their contributions are subtle, they are essential to building fictional worlds and making the stories on screen feel believable.
