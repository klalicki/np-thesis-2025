Are you an EOP student curious about studying abroad but unsure where to start? You’re not alone—I was in the same position. Studying abroad can be a life-changing experience, but many EOP (Educational Opportunity Program) students feel it’s out of reach due to financial concerns and lack of guidance. With my thesis project, I hope to tackle these challenges by creating a practical, easy-to-follow website tailored specifically for EOP students.

As an EOP student myself, I’ve experienced the confusion and obstacles that can come with trying to study abroad. This project combines personal stories, financial advice, step-by-step planning tools, other resources and people you can contact to make this confusing process more manageable.

The goal is simple: to empower more EOP students to take advantage of global learning opportunities by giving them the tools, knowledge, and confidence to make it happen.

Studying abroad is possible—and this project is here to prove it.
