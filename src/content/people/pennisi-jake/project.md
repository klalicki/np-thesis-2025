My thesis uses nostalgic forms to explore how play changes over time. It reimagines childhood toys as functional desktop tools. Inspired by the colorful, interactive designs I grew up with, I’ve redesigned them into devices that blend fun with everyday utility. This project isn’t just about revisiting the past, it’s about showing how play matures. In childhood, play is rooted in imagination and open-ended discovery, free from specific purpose. As time passes, that instinct often shifts toward productivity and structured routines. Designing, modeling, and building reflects that evolution. Today, play for me is embedded in process-oriented creativity, still joyful and rich in imagination, but now shaped by intention and purpose. By combining familiar, playful aesthetics with practical features, I highlight how play doesn’t disappear as we grow up, it adapts. Whether through form, color, or function, the goal is making a workstation more fun and interactive while inviting viewers to rethink the line between work and play, bridging who we were with who we are today.
