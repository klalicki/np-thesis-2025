_The Color “Violet”_ is a website that documents interactions with shades of violet. It explores the idea that only one color is needed to design. Focusing specifically on violet, a neutral tone with few emotional associations that allows for flexibility and experimentation. Inspired by the circadian rhythm, the natural 24-hour clock that regulates our behavior in response to the environment, this project creates a color palette mapped to each point in the cycle. It's a time-based color system that reflects emotions and experiences using only one color. The website functions as a personal visual archive that blends structured grid layouts with spontaneous, process-driven design play. Through various tools, geometric forms, and typographic experiments, _The Color “Violet”_ becomes a multimedia design exploration centered on the emotional and conceptual potential of designing with a single color, demonstrating how violet can influence mood, rhythm, and visual storytelling.
