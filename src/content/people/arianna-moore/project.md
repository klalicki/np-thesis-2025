It is difficult to find instructional piano books that teach piano music in an easy to understand and engaging way. Adult learners face many challenges compared to those who started learning at a younger age. Younger people have an easier time learning because they are still figuring out motor skills and memorization, both necessary in learning the piano, and can manipulate hands and brain easier than someone older who is used to doing things certain ways. Current piano lesson books are meant to be paired with an instructor. A lot of beginner books are also geared towards younger students, they also require multiple books that need to be purchased. This project, _Piano_, is an instructional piano book intended for adults who would like to learn music and how to play the piano. It will be directed towards beginners who are trying to learn on their own, without an instructor. The lessons are presented in a way that covers visual, tactile, and auditory learning styles.
