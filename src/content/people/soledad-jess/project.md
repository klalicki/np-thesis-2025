Neon art and signage are everywhere, yet we often walk past them every day without noticing their craft and beauty, their rich history, and or the community in which they exist. _I HEART NEON_ is a response to discovering more information about neon, and wanting to share my love and ongoing connections with the community.

This photobook serves as a collection of pure eye candy; colorful, one-of-a-kind, neon signs. Alongside images and diagrams, the photobook also includes a brief history of neon and a crash course on how neon signs are made. I interviewed various artists and design studios who talk about their love of the medium, the inspirations they carry with them, and the current projects and restorations they and their teams are currently working on.
