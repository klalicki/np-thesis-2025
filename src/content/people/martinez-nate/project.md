bio: |
  Nate is a senior graduating this Fall from Suny New Paltz, their design specialties include illustration and layout design, both of which are featured in their thesis project. A creative goal Nate will achieve in the future is to contribute to a story in a studio setting or through freelance work, whether by helping others bring their stories to life or developing their own. What keeps Nate motivated every day is the thought that there’s so much to create, yet so little time.

Have you ever had an idea that you wanted to bring to life? My project is a comic book pitch that explores story development, worldbuilding, and character design. This project is dear to me because it revives a dream I once had, offering a new path to follow. What inspired me was my love for animation and how you can create life through drawings. This comic is for anyone who wants to see my creative process; from writing a story to developing a world and crafting characters. I approached it by breaking down each section of comic creation, studying and refining my choices step by step. I hope to inspire other creative individuals to embark on their own creative journey. Most importantly, this project taught me it’s never too late to create something you’re passionate about, regardless of what others think.
