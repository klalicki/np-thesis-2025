Like so many Black women, my hair journey wasn’t just about style, it was about finding myself and self love.

The book I’ve created holds real moments many Black women recognize as our mothers doing our hair, the deep breath before walking into work or school with our natural styles, and that instant connection when we spot someone else who chose freedom over conforming to societal norms. 

Through these images and honest stories collected from over 20 Black women and expressed through experimental typography, we celebrate the beauty society told us to hide. We laugh over failed wash days, cry through memories of chemical burns, and beam with pride at our natural hair.

These are our truths. Our heritage. Our crowns. Join us in this celebration of Black hair not as a statement, but as ourselves unapologetically.
