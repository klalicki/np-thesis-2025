Character and avatar creators have existed for years. You may have designed your friends on the Sims, or looked up a simple avatar creator online to use for a presentation. The goals of these creators vary, but they work on the prospect of being able to “create anybody.” However, not all of these creators have the necessary range of body types, skin tones, or representation to be inclusive of a variety of people. My project, _<body>_, is an avatar creator designed to allow users to create themselves without sacrificing aspects of their identity, such as disabilities, religion, sexuality, or gender expression. Ideally, when using the _<body>_ website, it’s more than just creating anybody, you can create everybody. This website was designed on GitHub and edited through HTML and CSS coding to be more accessible, with help from Shauna Keating and Kristoff Lalicki. This outcome captures the unique student body of the SUNY New Paltz campus. Through discussion and user-testing with students, I was given insight into what they felt represented themselves on a personal level. Everyone should be able to create an avatar that represents themselves without sacrifice. I hope _<body>_ can be this for you.
