Have you ever thought about how an art studio is like a science lab? Are artists secretly mad scientists? The intersection of the two subjects gives us a deeper understanding of the techniques artists used in the past and how to preserve artwork for the future. _ArtSci’s_ art and science kits blend the two subjects together in an engaging and playful way for young audiences. The projects and lessons are made for young children and families, with playful colors and imagery found throughout each kit. The simple nature of the projects creates an accessible lesson that can be adapted to a wide range of age groups. With projects that range from making ancient frescos to contemporary art each kit will have something for all learners to enjoy. _ArtSci_ encourages kids to ask “how”, “what”, and “why” as they create and explore the world around them.
