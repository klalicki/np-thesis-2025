Did you know that ancient Greek goddess Aphrodite is also a playable character in video games? From art, movies, and books, such as the Percy Jackson book series, Greek mythology continues to be a source of inspiration in countless works of fiction and pop culture. The video game industry is a large contributor to this, with Greek myths serving as a foundation for iconic characters, such as Medusa, Hades, and many others. _Divine Arts_ is a book that explores character designs inspired by Greek myths and the unique ways different video games interpret the characters and stories. The book dives into the original ancient myths and compares them to many different interpretations within video game series. The book not only provides some insight into the character design process but also is an act of celebration for the creativity of these designs across different video games. Whether you are into video games, Greek mythology, or both, this book can not only provide new information, but act as a creative spark to inspire visual designers.
