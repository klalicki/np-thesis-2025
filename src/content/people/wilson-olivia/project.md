Inspired by the dedication of clinical staff, including my family and friends, I volunteered at The Valley Hospital in Paramus, NJ, to design a gratitude recognition solution tailored to their needs. Throughout this journey, I developed a gratitude initiative involving over 40 nurses and clinical staff. The goal was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their existing digital gratitude system through observational research, surveys, and interviews. The final result is a user-centered digital recognition system designed to uplift clinical staff through meaningful peer-to-peer recognition, various public recognition methods, and integrated rewards. Thank you to The Valley Hospital, Brianne De La Rosa, Jordan Minnema, and the clinical staff who participated in this project.
