bio: |
  Johnny is a graduating senior from Westchester, NY, specializing in identity, branding, layout, and interface design. He’s drawn to eco-conscious design that blends hands-on making with thoughtful digital storytelling—whether that’s turning old clothes into something new or building a brand with intention. His thesis reflects this balance, bringing together sustainability, style, and purpose in one project. When he's not creating, he's probably doing yoga, getting lost in antique stores, or trying (and failing) to teach his cat how to roll over.

_RENU_ is a creative response to the waste and overconsumption driving today’s fashion industry. Fast fashion pushes out trends at the cost of the planet, but I believe what we wear can mean more. This project explores sustainable fashion through methods like upcycling, using existing materials, and rethinking how clothing is made. 

_RENU_ highlights that sustainable design doesn’t need to be complicated or out of reach but instead it can be personal and rooted in what we already have. I collaborated with four students at SUNY New Paltz to create one-of-a-kind garments, all made from existing garments and fabric scraps.

Beyond the clothing, I designed the branding and visual identity for _RENU_, combining hands-on making with digital storytelling. This project is about designing with intention, and creating fashion in consideration of both people and the planet. _RENU_ invites you to rethink what clothing can be, and how even small choices can help shift the future of fashion. 

Special thanks to Emely Moncion ’25, Olivia Wilson ’25, Faith Wilson ’26, and Kotomi Inaba ’26 for collaborating with me on the garment designs.
