bio: |
  Kat is a graduating senior who has been drawn to packaging design since she could walk. The admiration began at age four, when she started stashing ice cream wrappers from the neighborhood ice cream man behind the living room couch. She draws inspiration from her extensive perfume and packaging collection, as well as album covers, billboards, and ads from the music industry…especially anything from Lady Gaga.

Procrastination is the act of delaying something despite the negative consequences that come along with it. The common answer to why we procrastinate may be a lack of time management or laziness, but this habit stems far beyond those ideas. It’s a misunderstood habit, leaving many of us stuck in this cycle of stress and negative consequences.

In order to overcome the habit of procrastination, it’s important for us to understand how we work and what keeps us in this cycle. Procrastinators fall under six different types of workers: the Worrier, the Dreamer, the Defier, the Over-Doer, the Crisis-Maker, and the Perfectionist. Finding which category you fall under is your first step to breaking away from this cycle. Over the past year, I’ve done research on the topic by reading articles, talking with psychologists, and holding workshops on campus to gather stories from students. _What’s Your Procrastination Type?_ is an illustrated guidebook for students to understand their work style, the causes of their procrastination, and offers tools to manage the challenges that many students face.
