Books have been part of human history for thousands of years, though their earliest forms looked nothing like the ones we know today. Originally, they were handcrafted with great care—luxury items meant to be treasured. In today’s digital and fast-paced world, books are mass-produced, and the artistry behind them is often overlooked. Bookbinding has become a mechanical process, and creative, hand-bound books now mostly exist within niche artist communities. Even in our graphic design program, where we have a room dedicated to bookbinding, the craft itself has largely been forgotten.

This project explores the value of handmade work in contrast to mass production and reimagines the book as more than just a container for content. It invites viewers to reconnect with the tactile, visual, and emotional experience of physical books, and to consider the act of making as meaningful in itself.

_The Art of Bookbinding_ is a series of zines created to introduce others to the basics of bookbinding through beginner-friendly techniques and methods. Each guide is paired with an instructional video, walking viewers through the process step-by-step. These guides make bookbinding approachable, engaging, and accessible to anyone interested in learning.
