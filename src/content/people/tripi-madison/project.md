How ready do you feel to be an adult? The clock is ticking, and soon enough, we will be out of college and into the real world. The expectation to have all the answers can feel overwhelming, especially when the unexpected occurs. For this reason, it became clear why many of my peers expressed fear about the next phase of life after graduating college. Being fully mature in society refers to owning a home, managing finances, and establishing healthy habits in our daily lives but what if I’m too late or what if I do not know where to begin or just flat out don’t know what I’m doing? To reach the target audience of young adults graduating SUNY New Paltz, I talked to a range of people who shared personal stories of when things didn’t go as planned. I then used the stories to create an “adult” version of the well-known game, Chutes and Ladders, with a couple twists such as “Let’s Vote” and “Sweet Treat” cards. The game is designed to help young adults relate to real-life experiences in a fun, relatable way. It shows that setbacks in adulthood are normal, growth takes time, and sometimes the best thing you can do is laugh and learn.
